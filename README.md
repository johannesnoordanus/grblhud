# grblhub
**Grblhud** is an interactive grbl1.1 control center. It is easy to install and needs python version 3.7 or above. It runs on Linux and MacOS (not on windows, but see below). 

**Grblhud** can run as a commandline program to stream gcode files directly to a grbl1.1 compatible machine. Just type 'grblhud gcodefile'.

Streaming is done via a buffer counting protocol as described by the grbl standard and is error free and fast.

**Grblhud** can run in interactive mode. Just type 'grblhud<enter>'.

This mode features full control of the grbl v1.1 device and supports <i>realtime</i> direct commands and buffered streaming of commands and programs.

Grbl state is realtime in line viewable, showing head location (XYZ) and the machine state *Idle, Run, Hold, Jog, Alarm, Door, Check, Home, Sleep* in color. State also includes current buffered (pending) gcode blocks (and no scrolling *ok's*).

Grbl v1.1 error and Alarm code definitions are shown when they occur.

Spindle and Feed settings can be updated realtime while gcode is running; gcode programs can be loaded and run with specific *Spindle* and *Feed* settings.

It is possible to easily draw a bounding box of a gcode program and set a new origin (workspace coordinates).

CNC machines can do a Z probe to easily put the bit right on top of the object (to be CNC'd).

Gcode loops are simulated (using a very simple WHILE DO syntax that must be annotated within the gcode) and can be run separately and (be) iterated at will.

Soft and hard-resets can be issued and *Ctrl-D* makes a full stop (to machine state *Door*).

This makes it easy to laser draw and cut without the need to (re)connect the device, so drawings and cuts have full (relative) machine precision.

**Grblhub** is tested on several platforms - arm64/intel - and operating systems - Linux/macosx and two grbl v1.1 devices (a lasercutter and a CNC router). Note that it does not run on windows! (This is because Python module *termios* isn't available for windows. This library depends on POSIX which isn't part of the windows operating system. Note that you could install linux on a virtual machine on windows and use grblhud from a terminal on that.)

Information on grbl commands: https://github.com/gnea/grbl/blob/master/doc/markdown/commands.md

Note that *image2gcode* and *svg2gcode* can be used to convert images and vector graphics to gcode at the highest quality. *gcode2image* can be used to validate these conversions and verify the layout before using *grblhud* to send the code to your lasercutter or cnc machine. https://github.com/johannesnoordanus?tab=repositories

Also: *grblhud* now has a *showgcode* command, that runs *gcode2image* to show the currently loaded gcode (this includes the origin, size and orientation of the image). Note that *gcode2image* must be *pip* installed first (a lot of python library code is needed for this to run, which might be too much for small computers having a low network bandwidth)

Please consider supporting me, so I can make this application better and add new functionality to it: <http://paypal.me/johannesnoordanus/5,00>
### First run:
As shown below. If you do not specify a serial device, *grblhud* will open a default one and on error show a list of possible candidates you can choose one from, or type a device name you know.
It then starts a status report and run loop.

If you add file names to the command, *grblhud* will stream the files directly to the device in non interactive mode. It does show a realime status report as mentioned below.

Without file names grblhud enters interactive mode. 
You can enter grbl(hud) commands from that point.

The prompt shows realtime status information of the machine you are connected to (see the explanation of the *grblhud>* prompt below).

It is possible to 'stream' a gcode file 'directly' to the machine (via command *stream <file>*) or via a buffer (via commands *load <file>* and *run*).
The buffered approach makes additional features available, like running LOOPs and bounding boxes and updating F and S values for a specific gcode run.

To exit, type *exit*.

Look at the short command summary below, so you are able the control the laser machine directly.
Note that *load* and *run* commands can take a while on large gcode files, do not panic, realtime load/run information is shown and load/run can be aborted via *anykey* or ```<Ctrl><C>```.</br>
When you do panic, because your laser machine is hitting walls etc, type ```<Ctrl><D>```, (or ```<Ctrl><C>``` first when commands *run* or *load* are executing)!

### Grblhud help:
See notes below.
```
$ grblhud --help
usage: grblhud [-h] [--serial <default:/dev/ttyUSB0>] [-V] [gcode ...]

Interactive grbl1.1 control center.
  Type 'grblhud file' to stream file(s) to your machine
  Type 'grblhud<enter>' to start the interactive 'hud'.

positional arguments:
  gcode                 gcode file(s) to stream to your machine

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --serial <default:/dev/ttyUSB0>
                        serial device of your machine (115200 baud)
  -V, --version         show version number and exit
```
You can also store the device setting in ~/.config/grblhud.toml, eg:
```
serial = "/dev/ttyUSB0
```
It can be used with any parameter which takes a value, and alows to persist your laser settings.

```
### WHILE DO syntax:
Grblhud unrolls loops when files are loaded (via command *load <filename>*) and subsequently run (via command *run*)
Loops can be defined within a gcode file, as comments *;* using the syntax show below, or be defined by command *setLOOP*.
```
    # Gcode:
    #    #100 = 1
    #    WHILE [#100 LE 5] DO1
    #    (Some G-Code Blocks Go Here to Be Repeated Each Loop)
    #    #100 = #100 + 1 (Increase #100 by 1 each iteration of the loop)
    #    END1
    
    # Simulate gcode WHILE DO instructions (above) like this:
    #    ; WHILE <count> <loopname>'    example: '; WHILE 23 aloop123'
    #    (Some G-Code Blocks Go Here to Be Repeated Each Loop)
    #    ; DO <loopname>'               example: '; DO aloop123'
    #
    # Note that this is an annotation (quoted out so the grbl controller does not see it)
    # Note also that loopnames are all lowercase! And have a number (if any) at the end:
    # in regex '[a-z]+[0-9]*'
```
